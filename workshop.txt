description=[h3]Notes:[/h3]
description=I know CocoLiquidOverhaul have a lot of problems and it is old, I was just starting out (it's my first mod).
description=So I decided to not include all the feature such as Fuel etc... Will probably dedicate an other mod to making custom fuel containers in the future.
